# 🛍️ VibeCart – Personalized Product Recommender

**VibeCart** is a minimal, responsive shopping app that recommends products based on your personal taste.  
Instead of swiping, users can **like** or **skip** products, helping the app learn their preferences to serve more tailored suggestions in future sessions.

This project is frontend-heavy and built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**. It is designed to be clean, intuitive, and extensible — ready for future integration with an ML recommendation model.
